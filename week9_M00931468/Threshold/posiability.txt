The dream which YOU hold in your mind. It is possible I need YOU to invest in your mind. If YOU're still talking about your dream, if YOU're still talking about your goals, but YOU have not done anything, JUST TAKE THE FIRST STEP! You can make your parents proud, YOU can make your school proud, YOU can touch millions of people's lives and the world will never be the same again, because YOU came this way! Don't let nobody steal your dream! After we face a rejection and a NO, we have a meeting and no one shows up, or somebody says "YOU can count on me", and they don't come through. What if we had that kind of attitude that caused repossession. Nobody believes in YOU, YOUâ€™ve lost again and again and again. The lights are cut off, but YOU're still looking at your dream, reviewing it everyday and saying to yourself: "It's not over until I win!" You can live your dream!
